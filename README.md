# Milk Quality Prediction
This project involves developing a machine learning model for predicting the quality of milk based on various physical and chemical attributes, using classification techniques in R. The dataset consists of features such as pH, temperature, taste, odor, fat content, turbidity, and color, with the target variable being the grade of the milk (classified as "low", "medium", or "high"). We employed a Random Forest classifier to train the model, and performance metrics like accuracy were used to evaluate its effectiveness. The model was saved and deployed via a Plumber API, which allows users to make real-time predictions by providing relevant milk quality attributes as input. The API processes the input data, applies the trained model, and returns the predicted milk grade. This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning for quality assessment in the food industry.
